# YuGiOh Virtual Link
 
YuGiOh Virtual Link is a VR recreation of the classic Trading Card Game series. This project tries to recreate the anime style of battles while keeping the game intuitive. This project started early development on Oct 20th, 2024.

# Current Features
Currently implemented features include:
* Full Card Database
* 3D generation of card by id.

# To-Do
Features I wish to finish soon
* ~Card Database~
* ~Card Generation by ID~
* ~VR world~
* Picking up Cards in VR.
* Moving around in VR.
* Deck Creator.
* Playing Field
* Rules preventing inacurate moves.
* 3D models for every card.
 * This is to further immerse the player in the game by making visual representations of monsters, spells, traps, and etc. I will most likely hire a 3D modeler. (Reach out if you are one and are willing to work free because im broke!)
